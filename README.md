Optimizing the right Team for Dream 11

The paper describes a retrospective approach to team selection using the real-world data collected from Player performances in the last 10 matches, to propose a Dream 11 Fantasy team for the upcoming match. The technique used is Integer Programming, implemented using the Gurobi library in Python. The team selection problem has also been analyzed through the lens of Markowitz Optimization, which is mostly used to select stocks in a financial portfolio. The concept of risk aversion has been applied to penalize inconsistent performances, as risk taking and risk averse users might want to bet on different odds for the same match.
